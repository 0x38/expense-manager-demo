Example app showing the use of Vaadin Grid and Charts with a REST data source


To run, do `npm install && bower install` then `gulp serve` to run locally with browser sync.
 
The demo uses [Vaadin Charts](https://vaadin.com/charts), which will ask for a license. You can close the window to try out the app without a license. 

Can be used standalone with a small (250) demo dataset, or together with a [REST API backend](https://github.com/vaadin-marcus/expense-app-backend)_for a larger, 10,000 item dataset.
