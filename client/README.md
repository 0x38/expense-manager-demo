Example app showing the use of Vaadin Grid and Charts with a REST data source

To run, do `npm install && bower install` then `gulp serve` to run locally with browser sync.

The demo uses [Vaadin Charts](https://vaadin.com/charts), which will ask for a license. You can close the window to try out the app without a license.

By default, it will use a small (250) demo dataset, but you can also use it together with a the REST Serve found in the `server` folder for a larger, 10,000 item dataset.
